**Welcome to DMSA**

🚀 A Space for Prototyping and Experimentation

**About**

This is my personal organization where I explore new ideas, rapidly prototype products, and experiment with different technologies. I primarily work with:

React & Next.js for frontend development

Golang for backend services


🚀 **Purpose**

To quickly prototype and test product ideas while improving my skills in building scalable and maintainable applications.

🏗 **Tech Stack**

I use a modern tech stack optimized for experimentation and rapid development:

Languages: Golang, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python

Frontend: React, Next.js

Backend: Golang, Node.js, REST APIs

Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis

Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Docker, CI/CD

Emails: Resend

Billing: Stripe

🔥 **Projects**

Private for now. I've only made my boilerplate for SaaS public. Feel free to explore base-server, base-webapp, base-infra

👥 Collaborations

While this is a personal playground for prototyping, I'm always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to fork, open issues, or submit PRs if you find something interesting!
